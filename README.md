## Project Description

Hello! This is Group 19228's code that controls a simple circuit of an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor and a soil moisture sensor. The purpose of this project is to maintain the ideal light intensity and soil moisture level for indoor planting.

The application continuously monitors the light intensity and soil moisture. Based on the readings from the sensors, it automatically adjusts the lighting and watering systems to create an optimal environment for plant growth.

This project is built using Arduino and consists of the necessary circuitry to interface with the sensors. The code is written in C++, and the repository contains the code files, circuit diagrams, and documentation.
